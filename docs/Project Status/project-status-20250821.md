# SecureAccess Development - Daily Progress Report

## Authentication System Enhancements

### ✅ Profile Page Authentication Fix
- **Issue Resolved**: Profile page was redirecting back to login due to HTTP-only cookie transmission failure
- **Solution Implemented**: Added localStorage token fallback system
- **Technical Details**:
  - Modified login endpoint to include token in response (`result.data.token`)
  - Updated login client to store token in localStorage as backup
  - Enhanced profile page API calls to use Authorization header when cookies fail
  - Maintained HTTP-only cookie as primary authentication method

### ✅ Server-Side Authentication Improvements
- **Enhanced JWT Verification**: Updated `/api/auth/verify` endpoint with detailed logging
- **Dual Authentication Support**: Server now accepts both HTTP-only cookies and Bearer tokens
- **CORS Configuration**: Added multiple development server origins for cross-origin support
- **Cookie Settings Optimization**: Configured cookies with `sameSite: 'lax'` and `secure: false` for development

### ✅ Profile Management System
- **Profile Data Loading**: Successfully implemented user profile data retrieval via `/api/users/me` endpoint
- **Security Answer Handling**: Added proper placeholder text for security answers
- **User Experience**: Profile page now displays existing user data and allows updates
- **Data Security**: Maintained hashed storage for security answers while providing clear user guidance

### ✅ Failed Login Attempt Protection
- **Attempt Tracking**: Implemented failed login counter with configurable threshold
- **Automatic Redirect**: Added redirect to `FailedPage` after reaching `FailedAttempts` limit
- **Counter Reset**: Failed attempts reset on successful login
- **Configurable Settings**: Used global variables `FailedAttempts` and `FailedPage` for easy configuration

### ✅ User Interface Improvements
- **Placeholder Text Optimization**: Shortened security answer placeholders to "Leave empty to keep current"
- **Space Efficiency**: Reduced UI element spacing for better screen utilization
- **User Guidance**: Clear instructions for password and security answer updates

### ✅ Database Integration
- **Security Data Retrieval**: Enhanced `/users/me` endpoint to include security question hashes
- **Profile Updates**: Implemented secure profile update functionality via `/users/me` PUT endpoint
- **Data Validation**: Proper handling of optional fields and password updates

## Technical Architecture Achievements

### ✅ Hybrid Authentication System
- **Primary Method**: HTTP-only cookies for enhanced security
- **Fallback Method**: localStorage with Authorization headers for compatibility
- **Seamless Operation**: Automatic fallback without user intervention

### ✅ Server Configuration
- **Static File Serving**: Configured server to serve client files from same origin
- **Cookie Parser**: Properly configured cookie-parser middleware
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error responses with detailed logging

### ✅ Security Best Practices
- **Token Management**: Secure JWT token generation and verification
- **Password Hashing**: Maintained bcrypt hashing for all sensitive data
- **Session Management**: Proper token expiration and cleanup
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with proper authorization checks
