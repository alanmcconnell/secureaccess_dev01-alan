JWT (JSON Web Tokens) implementation depends on what you're trying to accomplish, but here are the key concepts and steps:
Basic JWT workflow:

Authentication - User logs in with credentials, server validates and creates a JWT
Token structure - JWTs have three parts: header.payload.signature (separated by dots)
Client storage - Store the token securely (usually in memory, httpOnly cookies, or secure storage)
Authorization - Include the token in requests (typically in Authorization header as "Bearer <token>")
Validation - Server verifies the token's signature and expiration on each request

Common implementation approaches:
For the server side (creating/validating tokens):

Use a JWT library for your language (jsonwebtoken for Node.js, PyJWT for Python, etc.)
Sign tokens with a secret key or private key
Set appropriate expiration times
Include necessary user data in the payload (but avoid sensitive info)

For the client side (using tokens):

Store tokens securely (avoid localStorage for sensitive apps)
Include tokens in API requests
Handle token expiration (refresh tokens or re-authentication)
Clear tokens on logout

Key security considerations:

Use HTTPS to prevent token interception
Keep tokens short-lived when possible
Implement proper token refresh mechanisms
Validate tokens on every protected route
Use strong signing algorithms (RS256 or HS256)






##- Amazon Q

The token mock-jwt-token-1754400657550 is a fake/mock token for development purposes.

Looking at the backend code in authController.js, it generates this token with:

const token = 'mock-jwt-token-' + Date.now();

Copy
javascript
This is not a real JWT token because:

No encryption/signing - it's just a string with timestamp

No payload data - real JWTs contain encoded user data

No security - anyone can generate similar tokens

Development only - meant for testing without full JWT implementation

A real JWT token would look like:

The current system uses mock tokens for development. To implement real JWT tokens, you would need to:

Use the jsonwebtoken library to sign tokens

Include user data in the payload

Set expiration times

Verify signatures on each request
