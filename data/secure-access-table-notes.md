I've created the complete SQL commands to build all the tables for your 'secureaccess' database. The script includes:
Key Features:

All tables with proper primary keys and foreign key relationships
Appropriate data types and constraints for MySQL
Security-focused fields (password hashing, encryption, JWT support)
Comprehensive indexing for performance
Audit trail capabilities
User preferences and session management

Security Considerations:

Passwords are stored as hashes with salts
Encryption keys are properly versioned
JWT tokens include blacklist support
Comprehensive audit logging
Session management with expiration

Performance Optimizations:

Strategic indexes on frequently queried columns
Proper foreign key relationships
Timestamp fields for efficient date-based queries

The script is ready to run against your existing 'secureaccess' MySQL database. Make sure to review the field sizes and constraints to ensure they meet your specific application requirements.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. Sonnet 4CopyPublish
