## Technical Stack Considerations

### Backend Options
- **API Framework:** Node.js (Express), Python (FastAPI/Django), Java (Spring Boot), or C# (.NET)
- **Authentication:** JWT with refresh token rotation
- **Encryption:** AES-256 for password storage, bcrypt/Argon2 for master passwords
- **Database:** MySQL (already established)

### Frontend Options
- **Web Application:** React, Vue.js, or Angular
- **Mobile Apps:** React Native, Flutter, or native development
- **Desktop Apps:** Electron, Tauri, or native applications

### Security Standards
- **Compliance:** Consider GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2 requirements
- **Encryption:** End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- **Authentication:** Multi-factor authentication support
- **Auditing:** Comprehensive logging and monitoring

---

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Data Breaches:** Implement zero-knowledge architecture
2. **Password Exposure:** Use client-side encryption
3. **Authentication Bypass:** Multi-layered security validation
4. **Database Compromise:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest
5. **Session Hijacking:** Secure JWT implementation with short expiration

### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Implement security headers and HTTPS everywhere
- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
- Regular backup testing and disaster recovery drills

## Success Metrics

### Security Metrics
- Zero successful unauthorized access attempts
- 100% password encryption coverage
- Complete audit trail for all sensitive operations
- Sub-second authentication response times
- 99.9% uptime availability

### User Experience Metrics
- User registration completion rate > 95%
- Password retrieval success rate > 99%
- Average response time < 200ms
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5

---

## Budget & Resource Considerations

### Development Team
- **Backend Developer(s):** 2-3 developers
- **Frontend Developer(s):** 2-3 developers
- **Security Specialist:** 1 consultant/developer
- **DevOps Engineer:** 1 engineer
- **QA Tester:** 1-2 testers

### Infrastructure Costs
